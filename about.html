    <h2>About Me<br><br></h2>
    <p>
        I am an MCA student with interest in Python, SQL, and Web Development. <br><br>
        
        I enjoy learning new technologies and building simple, clean applications. <br><br>
        
        I am a motivated and detail-oriented aspiring software professional with a strong foundation in Python, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, and a growing focus on building real-world, scalable applications. Currently in my final year of Master of Computer Applications (MCA), I am committed to continuously upgrading my technical skills and practical knowledge to meet industry standards. <br><br>
        
        I enjoy transforming ideas into functional digital solutions and believe in learning through hands-on practice and project-based development. My approach to technology is structured, analytical, and outcome driven whether it is database design, backend logic, or creating clean, responsive user interfaces. <br><br>
        
        I am actively strengthening my expertise in full-stack development, with particular interest in backend systems, RESTful APIs, and data-driven applications. Alongside technical growth, I value discipline, consistency, and problem-solving, which guide my professional mindset. <br><br>
        
        My long-term goal is to build a stable and impactful career in the tech industry while continuously improving my skills and contributing to meaningful projects. <br>
